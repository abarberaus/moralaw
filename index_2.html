                                    <h2>CRIMINAL DEFENSE, MILITARY JUSTICE &amp; FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY</h2>
                                    <p>I am Leonard Morales. I hope this website provides the information you are looking for and will help you find the lawyer you need. I hope I can be that lawyer.</p>

                                    <p>First and most importantly, I am a Trial Attorney. What that means is that everything I do is focused on winning your case at trial. Trials whether criminal or family are complicated matters. A great many factors go into bringing a trial together and in the presentation of your case. There might be mountains of evidence, a long line of witnesses, and the stakes are always high. Your future, your reputation and in many cases your freedom will be either preserved or destroyed by the outcome.</p>

                                    <p class="hide_me_small">I am no coward, I am a fighter. I will not turn your away simply because your case might be difficult, complex or distasteful. I will not shy away from a trial because of bad publicity or what others might think of you. Many cowardly lawyers turn away cases simply because the facts make them uncomfortable or the case seems difficult – they decide you are guilty or wrong without ever looking at your case. These are the same lawyers who often taut their win/loss records even though they have never gone to trial on a difficult case. Any mediocre lawyer can win a case with a completely sympathetic client and all the facts on their side; that is no Trial Lawyer. I have tried and won all manner of cases from Capital Murder to Federal RICO Conspiracy to Military Sexual Assault. In Family Court I have tried child custody cases before a juries, represented parents in danger of losing their children in CPS court.</p>

                                    <p>I don’t need a win/loss column – my results speak for themselves. I will take your case if I believe I can help you and achieve positive results on your behalf. I invite you to look over my website and contact me if you have questions or if would like to consult with me about your case. If I cannot help you I will certainly steer you in the right direction.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Leonard Morales, Attorney at Law</p>

            <p class="hide_me_small">First and foremost, I am a trial attorney. This means that everything I do is focused on fighting and winning at trial. I will not turn you away because your case might be distasteful or complex.

I fight cases regularly at all levels including State, Federal, Juvenile and Military courts-martial. I believe my results speak for themselves.</p>
            <p>I represent clients in a wide array of legal matters, and I am not afraid to represent you in a court of law. I understand the legalities involved with any matter, and I have the experience necessary to handle any type of case, no matter the complexities.</p>

Would my husband be found guilty and spend the rest of life incarcerated for a crime he did not commit? Would we regain our lives prior to these allegations? I had my life and my trust put on Mr. Morales... Words could never do justice to the fantastic work Mr. Morales did. I would highly recommend him and his excellent and professional way he carries himself. We made the best choice by seeking the services from the best lawyer in El Paso.</div>

                                            <p><strong>Do Not Volunteer To Speak To Law Enforcement.</strong> Most importantly you must know that anything you say to <strong>anyone</strong> can and will be used against you. So do not answer any questions until you have spoken to a lawyer. By anyone I’m talking about any law enforcement of course but this includes talking to your close friends, family, spouse or even children. Even answers you might think assert your innocence can be twisted by law enforcement to seem like deception or outright lies. So say nothing! And do not trust what they tell you. It is perfectly legal for an officer or detective to lie to you to get you to talk. You are only legally required to give your Name, DOB, and address - nothing more. When using your right to remain silent you must be clear and specific. Say <strong>"I refuse to answer any questions without my lawyer." "I want a lawyer.”</strong> Asserting your right to remain silent cannot be used against you in any way – it can’t even be mentioned at trial.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>Military Service members</strong> – no one can issue you an order to talk or make a statement. You have the right to remain silent and to speak to counsel under Article 31 of the UCMJ. The problem is that the military often does not give you that lawyer until its too late. Military investigators, commanders, NCO’s will put great pressure on you to break – but don’t say anything until you have had some advice. Asserting your right to remain silent cannot be used against you in any way – it can’t even be mentioned at court martial (trial). I also handle all manner of military administrative cases. These are cases such as Administrative Separations (Chapters), Officer Eliminations, Rebuttals to Letters of Reprimand, AR 15-6 investigations, Show Cause Boards and other adverse actions.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>Do not volunteer anything to law enforcement.</strong> Do not volunteer or consent to any search of yourself or your property. If police, MPs or anyone else have a good legal basis for searching you or your property then they can get a warrant. If they search without a warrant do not interfere just continue to make clear that you are not consenting to any search of yourself or your person. </p>

                                            <h3>FAMILY LAW</h3>
                                            <p>The laws governing divorce and the division of the community estate in Texas are complex and imperfect. Nevertheless, these laws and the decisions of a Judge will have a great impact on your and your children’s life long after the divorce or custody battle is over.</p>
                                        </a>
                                        <div class="text">
                                            <!-- faq answer -->
                                            <p>I see many people who try to navigate the maze of the courthouse themselves. I see the person who falls for the billboard promising a cheap quick divorce or “uncontested divorce”. I see other people who are duped into trying to do it with a pre-prepared form from some website. <strong>Divorces in Texas are often more complex and complicated than people appreciate or anticipate.</strong> Even when people tell me they have agreed on the house, and shared custody of the kids. My next question is what happens when you two both want little Sally’s on her birthday? And what happens when you want to buy your next house or take out a loan and your Ex hasn’t refinanced the house like he promised. People want things to be simple but there are always details to work out and things that do need to be set in stone and in terms that are enforceable in court.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>Family law is a very local practice. <strong>It is my belief that 80% of what a divorce lawyer does is understanding what a judge will do in a given set of circumstances.</strong> Judges work hard to be consistent in their rulings. Your case may be unique to you. But the basic issues in dispute between you and your spouse are often very similar to those that the court has heard countless times before. Experience before the Courts is critical. <strong>I have over a decade of experience in the family courts of El Paso.</strong> My philosophy is to arm you with information so you can make the rational and practical decisions about what is best for you. You need to know what the Judge is likely to do so that you know what is worth fighting for and what is best to settle on.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>Military Divorce.</strong> If the breakdown of a family is complicated, the breakdown of a military family presents its own unique challenges. It's likely that you are only in Texas because of your spouse's service obligation. You now find yourself far from family support or even just friend to talk to. Because of my prior active duty experience (including deployments to Europe and the Middle East), I understand the unique challenges and pressure facing a military family. I understand the impact divorce will have not only on the division of your property, including any military retirement, but more importantly how this will impact your children.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>What can I do in the meantime to prepare and protect myself?</strong> You should begin to gather important documents. Mortgage statements, tax returns, pay stubs, outstanding bills and credit card statements. Often times the hardest things we have to prove in court are things you might think are the simplest. But your word is not often enough – documentation is key. You should put a fraud alert on your credit report with the major credit bureaus. (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). You don’t want your soon to be ex-spouse opening new lines of credit and debts only to leave you holding the bag. Gather names and contact information for anyone who you think might be able to offer information about your marriage or the children in case things go south. In short, prepare and leave nothing to hope or chance.</p>

                                            <h3>APPEALS</h3>
                                            <p>What is an appeal? In an appeal, you are not getting a do over. Instead, this process is meant to review legal errors or mistakes in the legal process that occurred in your case. Think of an appeal like instant replay review in professional football.</p>
                                        </a>

                                            <p> In football, the coach only has so much time to throw in the flag asking for a review. You can only review certain plays and the booth can only overturn the ruling on the field if there was some clear error. Appeals work in much the same way.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>Finding the right attorney could make all the difference, and it takes more than your average defense attorney to handle an appeal. <strong>An appellate court poses a completely different challenge from the challenges raised by a criminal court trial.</strong> You need to work with a legal advocate who understands the ins and outs of a successful appeal through personal experience.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>I do appeals in all areas in which I practice.</strong> I do all manner of Criminal Appeals – State, Federal, Military Courts Martial. I do Family Law and CPS Appeals.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>Time is of the essence in appeals.</strong> You only have a limited amount of time to appeal. If you believe you need an appeal contact my office immediately to schedule a consultation.
                                                <br>
                                                <br><strong>What do I need to see?</strong> I will need to see the Court Clerk’s Record – that record contains all of the pleadings or documents filed by the parties in the case and any orders issued by the Court. You can get that from the Clerk of Court. For example, for felony cases in El Paso County go to the first floor of the County Courthouse to the District Clerk’s Office. There you can order a copy of the Clerk’s Record. I will need transcripts of the trial, any hearings, or other proceedings in the case. That can be ordered from the court reporter for the court where the case was heard. There are fees for both the record and transcripts and it may take some time to produce these records. If you do not have these records I can still offer an opinion but my ability to accurately let you know your chances is greatly increased with more information.</p>

                                    <div class="text">
                                        <p>After law school I worked as an Assistant District Attorney for El Paso County for nearly a year. I then resumed my career with the U.S. Army in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). My four years on active duty included deployments to Europe, with the 1st Armored Division, and the Middle East, with the 1st Infantry Division.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>While on active duty as an Army JAG, I had the opportunity to prosecute and defend soldiers in cases worldwide. I also held a unique post as the Center Judge Advocate for William Beaumont Army Medical Center. My job there was to defend Army and Department of Defense (DoD) health care providers in medical malpractice cases. In addition to my private practice, I continue to serve our country in the U.S. Army Reserve where I currently hold the rank of Major with the 128th Legal Operational Detachment.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>I am primarily and most importantly, a trial attorney; this means I actually try cases in State, Federal and Military Courts. My focus is on fighting and winning at trial. I do not screen out or decline cases merely because they may be distasteful or complex. I will take your case if I believe that I can help you achieve a positive outcome.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>It is not my practice to dispose of cases as quickly as possible or to take on a high volume of clients. Each case is unique and one must consider your interests, the facts and circumstances concerning the case, and the realistic possibilities. My goal is to provide the best representation possible, tailored to your needs and objectives. Although I cannot guarantee any particular outcome (and nothing on this website should be construed as a guarantee of any certain result in any case), I do promise you will receive my best efforts.</p>

                                            <p>I do take on criminal cases outside of Texas in certain circumstances. It depends on the case and the rules of the court that I am trying to practice before. Some courts have very particular rules about lawyers from other states. Federal courts have rules that dictate how a lawyer from another state may practice before them. I am licensed in Texas and have taken cases in several other states. Do not be afraid to call on me simply because you are from another state in a criminal matter. Family law cases are another matter entirely. Family law is a very local practice. You have to know your local regulations and how your judge rules in any given set of circumstances. If you don't then you are not doing your client any good. It is for these reasons that I limit my family law practice to El Paso County.</p>

In Federal Cases, I have appeared nationwide. In military cases I represent Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines worldwide. Do Not Volunteer To Speak To Law Enforcement. Most importantly you must know that anything you say to anyone can and will be used against you. So do not answer any questions until you have spoken to a lawyer. By anyone I’m talking about any law enforcement of course but this includes talking to your close friends, family, spouse or even children. Even answers you might think assert your innocence can be twisted by law enforcement to seem like deception or outright lies. So say nothing! And do not trust what they tell you. It is perfectly legal for an officer or detective to lie to you to get you to talk. You are only legally required to give your Name, DOB, and address - nothing more. When using your right to remain silent you must be clear and specific. Say "I refuse to answer any questions without my lawyer." "I want a lawyer.” Asserting your right to remain silent cannot be used against you in any way – it can’t even be mentioned at trial. Military Service members – no one can issue you an order to talk or make a statement. You have the right to remain silent and to speak to counsel under Article 31 of the UCMJ. The problem is that the military often does not give you that lawyer until its too late. Military investigators, commanders, NCO’s will put great pressure on you to break – but don’t say anything until you have had some advice. Asserting your right to remain silent cannot be used against you in any way – it can’t even be mentioned at court martial (trial). I also handle all manner of military administrative cases. These are cases such as Administrative Separations (Chapters), Officer Eliminations, Rebuttals to Letters of Reprimand, AR 15-6 investigations, Show Cause Boards and other adverse actions. Do not volunteer anything to law enforcement. Do not volunteer or consent to any search of yourself or your property. If police, MPs or anyone else have a good legal basis for searching you or your property then they can get a warrant. If they search without a warrant do not interfere just continue to make clear that you are not consenting to any search of yourself or your person. </p>

                                <div class="name"><h3>FAMILY LAW</h3></div>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>The laws governing divorce and the division of the community estate in Texas are complex and imperfect. Nevertheless, these laws and the decisions of a Judge will have a great impact on your and your children’s life long after the divorce or custody battle is over. I see many people who try to navigate the maze of the courthouse themselves. I see the person who falls for the billboard promising a cheap quick divorce or “uncontested divorce”. I see other people who are duped into trying to do it with a pre-prepared form from some website. Divorces in Texas are often more complex and complicated than people appreciate or anticipate. Even when people tell me they have agreed on the house, and shared custody of the kids. My next question is what happens when you two both want little Sally’s on her birthday? And what happens when you want to buy your next house or take out a loan and your Ex hasn’t refinanced the house like he promised. People want things to be simple but there are always details to work out and things that do need to be set in stone and in terms that are enforceable in court. Family law is a very local practice. It is my belief that 80% of what a divorce lawyer does is understanding what a judge will do in a given set of circumstances. Judges work hard to be consistent in their rulings. Your case may be unique to you. But the basic issues in dispute between you and your spouse are often very similar to those that the court has heard countless times before. Experience before the Courts is critical. I have over a decade of experience in the family courts of El Paso. My philosophy is to arm you with information so you can make the rational and practical decisions about what is best for you. You need to know what the Judge is likely to do so that you know what is worth fighting for and what is best to settle on. Military Divorce. If the breakdown of a family is complicated, the breakdown of a military family presents its own unique challenges. It's likely that you are only in Texas because of your spouse's service obligation. You now find yourself far from family support or even just friend to talk to. Because of my prior active duty experience (including deployments to Europe and the Middle East), I understand the unique challenges and pressure facing a military family. I understand the impact divorce will have not only on the division of your property, including any military retirement, but more importantly how this will impact your children. What can I do in the meantime to prepare and protect myself? You should begin to gather important documents. Mortgage statements, tax returns, pay stubs, outstanding bills and credit card statements. Often times the hardest things we have to prove in court are things you might think are the simplest. But your word is not often enough – documentation is key. You should put a fraud alert on your credit report with the major credit bureaus. (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). You don’t want your soon to be ex-spouse opening new lines of credit and debts only to leave you holding the bag. Gather names and contact information for anyone who you think might be able to offer information about your marriage or the children in case things go south. In short, prepare and leave nothing to hope or chance.</p>

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>What is an appeal? In an appeal, you are not getting a do over. Instead, this process is meant to review legal errors or mistakes in the legal process that occurred in your case. Think of an appeal like instant replay review in professional football. In football, the coach only has so much time to throw in the flag asking for a review. You can only review certain plays and the booth can only overturn the ruling on the field if there was some clear error. Appeals work in much the same way. Finding the right attorney could make all the difference, and it takes more than your average defense attorney to handle an appeal. An appellate court poses a completely different challenge from the challenges raised by a criminal court trial. You need to work with a legal advocate who understands the ins and outs of a successful appeal through personal experience. I do appeals in all areas in which I practice. I do all manner of Criminal Appeals – State, Federal, Military Courts Martial. I do Family Law and CPS Appeals. Time is of the essence in appeals. You only have a limited amount of time to appeal. If you believe you need an appeal contact my office immediately to schedule a consultation. What do I need to see? I will need to see the Court Clerk’s Record – that record contains all of the pleadings or documents filed by the parties in the case and any orders issued by the Court. You can get that from the Clerk of Court. For example, for felony cases in El Paso County go to the first floor of the County Courthouse to the District Clerk’s Office. There you can order a copy of the Clerk’s Record. I will need transcripts of the trial, any hearings, or other proceedings in the case. That can be ordered from the court reporter for the court where the case was heard. There are fees for both the record and transcripts and it may take some time to produce these records. If you do not have these records I can still offer an opinion but my ability to accurately let you know your chances is greatly increased with more information.</p>
