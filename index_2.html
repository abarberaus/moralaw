                                        <p class="hide_me_small">First and foremost, I am a trial attorney. This means that everything I do is focused on fighting and winning at trial. I will not turn you away because your case might be distasteful or complex. Some lawyers will turn cases away simply because the subject matter makes them uncomfortable or the case appears difficult such as those involving child sexual assaults, capital murders, or RICO charges. I will take your case if I believe that I can help you and achieve positive results on your behalf. I fight cases regularly at all levels including State, Federal, Juvenile and Military courts-martial. I believe my results speak for themselves.</p>
                                        <p>I represent clients in a wide array of legal matters, and I am not afraid to represent you in a court of law. I understand the legalities involved with any matter, and I have the experience necessary to handle any type of case, no matter the complexities.</p>

The outcome of this trial would determine my life, my children's lives, and most off all the way my future life would turn out. Would my husband be found guilty and spend the rest of life incarcerated for a crime he did not commit? Would we regain our lives prior to these allegations? I had my life and my trust put on Mr. Morales... Words could never do justice to the fantastic work Mr. Morales did. I would highly recommend him and his excellent and professional way he carries himself. We made the best choice by seeking the services from the best lawyer in El Paso.</div>

                                            <p>After law school I worked as an Assistant District Attorney for El Paso County for nearly a year. I then resumed my career with the U.S. Army in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). My four years on active duty included deployments to Europe, with the 1st Armored Division, and the Middle East, with the 1st Infantry Division.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>While on active duty as an Army JAG, I had the opportunity to prosecute and defend soldiers in cases worldwide. I also held a unique post as the Center Judge Advocate for William Beaumont Army Medical Center. My job there was to defend Army and Department of Defense (DoD) health care providers in medical malpractice cases. In addition to my private practice, I continue to serve our country in the U.S. Army Reserve where I currently hold the rank of Major with the 128th Legal Operational Detachment.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>I am primarily and most importantly, a trial attorney; this means I actually try cases in State, Federal and Military Courts. My focus is on fighting and winning at trial. I do not screen out or decline cases merely because they may be distasteful or complex. I will take your case if I believe that I can help you achieve a positive outcome.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>It is not my practice to dispose of cases as quickly as possible or to take on a high volume of clients. Each case is unique and one must consider your interests, the facts and circumstances concerning the case, and the realistic possibilities. My goal is to provide the best representation possible, tailored to your needs and objectives. Although I cannot guarantee any particular outcome (and nothing on this website should be construed as a guarantee of any certain result in any case), I do promise you will receive my best efforts.</p>

                                                <p>I do take on criminal cases outside of Texas in certain circumstances. It depends on the case and the rules of the court that I am trying to practice before. Some courts have very particular rules about lawyers from other states. Federal courts have rules that dictate how a lawyer from another state may practice before them. I am licensed in Texas and have taken cases in several other states. Do not be afraid to call on me simply because you are from another state in a criminal matter. Family law cases are another matter entirely. Family law is a very local practice. You have to know your local regulations and how your judge rules in any given set of circumstances. If you don't then you are not doing your client any good. It is for these reasons that I limit my family law practice to El Paso County.</p>
